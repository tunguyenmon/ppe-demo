Production Performance Estimator Demo

Uses input data (tabular) to calculate via simplified DES as multi-step calculation.
Inputs:
- Production Plan
- Workloads (actual)
- Worklaods (predicted)
- Amount of Workers
- Worker Efficiency
- Worker Sick-Leave Amount
- Worker Holidays
- Worker Qualifications
- Worker Station Assignation
- Material-Flow/Flow Control
- Production Parameters(Cycletime, Shiftsystem etc.)
- Hangar technical efficiency
- Exception Days
- Worker Intelligence (Self Assignation)
- Unfinished Work handling

Outputs:
- Station/Worker Efficiency per Cycle
- Remaining Work per Part after line-exit
